# 📈 StockistAI – AI-Powered Stock Trend Forecasting

StockistAI is a **hybrid stock price prediction** application that leverages **LSTM (Deep Learning)** and **SVM (Machine Learning)** to analyze and forecast stock trends. Built with **Streamlit**, **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-Learn**, and **Yahoo Finance API**, this platform enables users to visualize stock data and make informed financial decisions.

## 🚀 Features

✅ **Real-Time Stock Data** – Fetch stock prices directly from Yahoo Finance  
✅ **LSTM Model for Deep Learning Forecasting** – Captures sequential patterns in stock trends  
✅ **SVM Model for Machine Learning Forecasting** – Enhances predictions with statistical learning  
✅ **Hybrid Model (LSTM + SVM)** – Combines both models for optimized performance  
✅ **Customizable Parameters** – Adjust LSTM time steps, epochs, batch size, and SVM kernel  
✅ **Interactive UI with Streamlit** – Simple, intuitive interface for easy stock analysis  
✅ **Performance Metrics** – Evaluate predictions using MAE and MSE  
✅ **Download Predictions as CSV** – Export results for further analysis
